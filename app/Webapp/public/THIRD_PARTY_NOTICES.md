# Third-Party Notices

This file lists the open-source components used by the COMPASS dashboard's
browser-based Speech-to-Text (STT) feature and the terms under which they are
distributed. All four components are included under permissive licences that
permit unrestricted use, including clinical research and commercial deployment.

**Licence compliance note — Moonshine model language.**
The MIT grant below (§1) applies only to the English Moonshine model currently
deployed (`moonshine-base-ONNX`). Switching to a non-English legacy Moonshine
model would place that model under the Moonshine AI Community Licence instead,
which is a different, non-commercial licence. Any such change must be reviewed
before shipping.

## 3. Hugging Face Transformers.js

**Package:** `@huggingface/transformers`
**Version:** 3.7.1
**Licence:** Apache-2.0

**Modification notice (Apache-2.0 §4b).**
The following COMPASS source files were ported and modified from the
Transformers.js `moonshine-web` example
(`https://github.com/xenova/transformers.js/tree/main/examples/moonshine-web`):

- `src/workers/stt.worker.ts` — ported from `src/worker.js`; top-level `await`
  replaced with an explicit `init()` function; VAD integration and session
  lifecycle added.
- `src/lib/sttConstants.ts` — ported from `src/constants.js` and
  `src/processor.js`; extended with `appendTranscript()`, HIPAA data-handling
  rationale, and COMPASS-specific configuration constants.
- `public/vad-processor.js` — ported from the example's AudioWorklet processor;
  Firefox 16 kHz resampler added.

These files were changed from their original form. The original example is
copyright Hugging Face and contributors, distributed under Apache-2.0.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and works based on it.

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any Legal Entity on behalf of

      Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any Legal Entity on behalf of
      whom a Work has been submitted to the Licensor, including individuals
      and entities that make contributions on behalf of the Licensor.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by
      such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s)
      alone or in combination with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
      submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
      (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
      Work or any Derivative Works constitutes patent willful infringement or
      contributory infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under
      this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation
      is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work
      or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet
      the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative
          Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, You must include a readable copy of the attribution
          notices contained within such NOTICE file, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own license statement for Your modifications and
      may provide additional grant of rights to use, copy, modify, merge,
      publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software,
      and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or reproducing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or exemplary damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or all other
      commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been
      advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
